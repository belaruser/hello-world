# hello-world

Hi, everybody!

My name is Pavel.
As you could guess already, I'm from Belarus.

I'm not a programmer or software developer. However my profession closely related to computers.
I'm electronics engineer. Programming is just a hobby.
I have some (a very little one) expirience in Python, PHP and Javascript.
Also I created and support some Internet projects that using AJAX and database technologies.

The main reason that brought me here is an educational one.
Please, don't be hypercritical to me. I'm just want to be better in programming, not a pro.
